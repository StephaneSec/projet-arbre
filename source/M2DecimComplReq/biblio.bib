  abstract = {Parameterized complexity theory is a recent branch of computational
	complexity theory that provides a framework for a refined analysis
	of hard algorithmic problems. The central notion of the theory, fixed-parameter
	tractability, has led to the development of various new algorithmic
	techniques and a whole new theory of intractability.
	
	This book is a state-of-the-art introduction to both algorithmic techniques
	for fixed-parameter tractability and the structural theory of parameterized
	complexity classes, and it presents detailed proofs of recent advanced
	results that have not appeared in book form before. Several chapters
	are each devoted to intractability, algorithmic techniques for designing
	fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, and bounded fixed-parameter
	tractability and subexponential time complexity. The treatment is
	comprehensive, and the reader is supported with exercises, notes,
	a detailed index, and some background on complexity theory and logic.
	
	The book will be of interest to computer scientists, mathematicians
	and graduate students engaged with algorithms and problem complexity.},
