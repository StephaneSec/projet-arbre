Hello,
as you can see, my project for this year is naming "graphs' decompositions and resolutions of combinatorial problems" 
and this one is supervisez by Florent Madeleine

# 2

With this slide you see the scheeme of my presentation. 
First, I will briefly expose the objectives of my project
Second I will show you two concepts (treewidth and nice tree) that I chose because they are the nerve point of my future work.
Finally, We will see an example of a problem's resolution which is using a nice tree and the treewidth.

This project talk about kind of trees which are representing graph. A graph is more complex than a tree but sometimes it is possible to reduce it in a tree representation to solve problems because a tree is easier to manipulate.
